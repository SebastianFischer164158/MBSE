## How to run the code
Constants can be changed in _constants.py_

Install dependencies
- Python 3.8
- SimPy

Run the program using 
>python.exe -m DistributedStructure.MainEnergyGrid.py

Results are saved in _plots/output.json_

Files in _/plots_ contain various plots. Requires running the main program first to generate the output JSON.

Plots are saved as a PDF in _/output_ (This folder might need to be created manually).
